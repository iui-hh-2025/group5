			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>Over the last few years, generative AI has swept the internet, popping up in everything from design software, chat bots, search engines, and social media sites. These tools are built using huge amounts of data, collected from across the internet. They are then programmed to answer questions or respond to prompts, using this gathered information. They can generate text, images, audio and other forms of media.</p>
			<p>While these tools can be fun and helpful, they are also making it increasingly difficult to determine whether online content is real, or created by AI. AI pictures, videos, deep-fakes and even news articles can spread misinformation like wildfire. The widespread accessibility and use of generative AI can undermine our sense of trust and have us questioning our reality.</p>
			<p>This website was made as a collaborative project by students at Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences in Finland and Indiana University Indianapolis in Indiana. It focuses on the use of AI-generated posts on Facebook specifically, as it is a social media site notorious for hosting this kind of content. <b>Factbook</b> seeks to educate the public on how to recognize these posts and what to do after encountering them.</p>
